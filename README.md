I guess no need for reflections for this lab either.

Biggest challenge was implementing the right Material UI components and its props to get the satisfied UI results. Surprised that MUI had some elegant and simple pagination components for me to use.

Next challenge was understanding the "shape" of a custom hook and how to implement the pagination. Lots of googling and AI to keep things simple. If I don't need to use a useEffect() then I won't unless the rubric requires me to.

Debounce was abstract to implement, figuring out using the useEffect with timeout and a cleanup return value.

Overall, custom hooks compartmentalizes functions and other hooks which makes code a bit more readable when working on components
